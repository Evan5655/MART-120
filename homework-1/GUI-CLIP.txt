A Comparison of GUI and CLI: Enhancing User Interaction  Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are two distinct methods of interacting with computer systems. 
While both serve the purpose of allowing users to communicate with computers, they differ significantly in their approach, usability, 
and advantages. 
This paper presents a comparison between GUIs and CLIs, highlighting their respective features and discussing their strengths and weaknesses.  
Graphical User Interface (GUI): GUI is a visual interface that employs icons, buttons, menus, and other graphical elements to interact with a computer system. 
GUIs are highly intuitive and user-friendly, making them ideal for users who may not have technical expertise. They provide a visual representation of the underlying actions, making complex tasks more accessible. 
GUIs often rely on direct manipulation, allowing users to interact with elements by clicking, dragging, and dropping.
